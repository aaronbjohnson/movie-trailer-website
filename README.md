### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to write server-side code to store a list of
favorite movies. Here I made use of the Youtube and OMDB database to deliver
current information about each movie entered into the movie list array. This
program will generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies, 
watch trailers, and get more information about the movies.
