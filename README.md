# Movie Trailer Website

**Movie Trailer Website** uses server-side code to store a list of
favorite movies. Youtube and OMDB APIs deliver current information about each
movie entered into the movie list array. This program will generate a static web
page allowing visitors to browse the movies, watch trailers, and get more
information about the movies.
